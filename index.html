  <h1>A Brief Journey Into Chernoff Faces</h1>
  <h2>Andrew Nolan</h2>
  <p>In the summer of 2020 I took the course CS 548, knowledge discover and data mining. One week we had lectures about data visualization. In one short slide, in one of those lectures the professor mentioned Chernoff Faces. Since then, for some reason these faces have infiltrated my thoughts much more often than they should. Since I am now going to learn d3 and data visualizations, I thought trying to recreate the data visualization that haunts my thoughts would be a good place to start. So here is my brief journey into Chernoff Faces...</p>

  <p>For those unfamiliar with the data vis, Chernoff Faces were invented in 1973 by the American mathemitician, Herman Chernoff. Chernoff Faces provide a way to visualize multivariate data by mapping data features to visual features on the face. The benefits of this visualization come from the claim that humans can easily recognize faces and identify small changes between them.</p>
